This is a ktor application build to retrieve book information from OpenLibrary API. It configures the routing for various endpoints in the application, including handling static files, rendering templates, and interacting with external APIs. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality in different paragraphs:

**NOTE** For some ISBN, the json response seemed to have more and more tricky problems to be shown in the .ftl file. But I tried testing it as many as possible and fixing the issues simulteneously.

**Package and Import Statements:**
    - The code begins with package and import statements that include necessary dependencies and modules for the Ktor application. This includes Ktor, Kotlinx Serialization, Exposed (for database access), and other required libraries.

**`configureRouting` Function:**
    - This function is an extension function for the Ktor `Application` class and is responsible for configuring the routing for different endpoints in the application.

**Static Files Serving:**
    - The `static("/static")` block specifies that static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) located in the "static" directory should be served to clients when requested.

**`GET("/")` and `POST("/submit-name")` Endpoints:**
    - These routes handle the initial landing page and form submission for a user's name. It uses the FreeMarker templating engine to render an HTML page.

**`GET("/home")` and `POST("/submit")` Endpoints:**
    - These routes handle the home page and book search form submission. They also interact with a database (likely using Exposed) to retrieve and store user data.

**`GET("/books/{isbn}")` Endpoint:**
    - This route handles requests for book information based on ISBN numbers. It makes an HTTP request to an external API (Open Library) to fetch book data and then renders it using FreeMarker templates.

**`GET("/cover/{query}")` and `POST("/submit-cover")` Endpoints:**
    - These routes handle requests to display book covers based on ISBN numbers. They retrieve images from the Open Library Covers API and render them using FreeMarker templates.

**`GET("/author/{query}")` and `POST("/submit-author")` Endpoints:**
    - These routes handle requests for author information based on user queries. They make HTTP requests to an external API (Open Library) to fetch author data and render it using FreeMarker templates.

**`AuthorModel.kt` and `BooksModel.kt` Files:**
    - These files contain Kotlin data classes that are used to deserialize JSON responses from external APIs into strongly typed objects. `AuthorModel.kt` represents author data, while `BooksModel.kt` represents book data.

**`Databases.kt` and `Usernames` Table:**
    - The code creates a database table named `Usernames` using Exposed, which is used to store user data such as usernames.

In summary, this code configures routing for a Ktor web application, handles various HTTP endpoints, communicates with external APIs to fetch book and author data, and interacts with a database to store and retrieve user information. It uses FreeMarker templates to render HTML responses.
